            <h3>Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I’m a junior web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and many more. I try to build websites that delight and inform. I’m curious and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using. If you're interested to work with me, then...</p>
